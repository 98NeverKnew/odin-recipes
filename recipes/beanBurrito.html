    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wrap tortillas in
        foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake wrapped tortillas in the preheated oven until heated through, about
        15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add onion,
        bell pepper, garlic, and jalape√±o; cook and stir for 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in beans and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Stir in
        cream cheese and salt; cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Stir
        in cilantro.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon filling in a line across the middle of each tortilla. Fold
        opposing edges of the tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the
        opposing edges around the filling creating a burrito. Serve immediately.
